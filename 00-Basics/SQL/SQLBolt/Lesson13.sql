/*
In this exercise, we are going to play studio executive and add a few movies to the Movies to our portfolio. 
In this table, the Id is an auto-incrementing integer, 
so you can try inserting a row with only the other columns defined.

Since the following lessons will modify the database, 
you'll have to manually run each query once they are ready to go.

Table: movies (Read-only)
id	title	director	year	length_minutes
1	Toy Story	John Lasseter	1995	81
2	A Bug's Life	John Lasseter	1998	95
3	Toy Story 2	John Lasseter	1999	93

Table: boxoffice (Read-only)
